## Kai Chen (Hong Kong Univ. of Science & Technology) - Towards Datacenter-Scale Deep Learning with Efficient Networking 

## Martin Wicke (Google) - Learning from Real-World Data with TensorFlow

<!--
Based on Google's experience with data processing and
machine learning at very large scale, we have developed TensorFlow, a
tool for machine learning that is both flexible enough to adapt to new
results in a quickly advancing field of machine learning; general
enough to be applied to any algorithm or input data one can throw at
it; and powerful enough to solve problems at scale. In this talk, I
will introduce TensorFlow, and show how we can use it to solve
problems involving large data, fast data, or uncommon deployment
environments.

*Bio*: Martin Wicke works on TensorFlow. Before joining Google, he
worked in various startups on Machine Learning, VR, and advanced
manufacturing. He did research on physics simulations, sensor
networks, and computational geometry at Berkeley and Stanford, and
holds a PhD from ETH Zurich.
