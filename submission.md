Papers should be submitted to the special issue **Big Data, IoT Streams and Heterogeneous Source Mining** of the [*International Journal of Data Science and Analytics*](https://www.editorialmanager.com/jdsa/).

Accepted papers will be presented in the workshop. Authors of accepted papers will also be given the opportunity to revise their papers in response to the reviewers' comments, and expanding the work by adding at least 20\% new material, to be considered for publication in the journal special issue.

<!-- Proceedings will be published as a dedicated volume of the [*JMLR: Workshop and Conference Proceedings*](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/) (this is not equivalent to a regular journal issue of JMLR). -->

<!-- The maximum length of papers is **16 pages** (i.e., as standard KDD papers) for regular papers, and **4-6 pages** for short papers. -->

Submitted papers may be formatted according to the format for the *International Journal of Data Science and Analytics*; and submitted under their [*submission system*](https://www.editorialmanager.com/jdsa/). Make sure to specify the relevant special issue when submitting: S.I. Big Data, IoT Streams and Heterogeneous Source Mining. <!-- Camera-ready papers should be in JMLR format. Note that camera-ready papers may be longer than the limits set for reviewing. -->

<!-- Please download the file [BIGMINE2016_template.zip](BIGMINE2016_template.zip) for the LaTex template and style file (or use the package directly as [provided by JMLR](http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/jmlr), making sure to insert the correct volume number: 53). Only the LaTex preparation system is supported for publication in the JMLR Workshop and Conference Proceedings series. -->

Following KDD main conference tradition, reviews are not double-blind, and author names and affiliations should be listed.

The deadline for submission is: **May 26th 23:59PM**.

<!-- Submit your paper through the [BIGMINE 2016 Sumission Site](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bigmine2016). -->
