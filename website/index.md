**6th International Workshop on Big Data, Streams and Heterogeneous Source Mining: Algorithms, Systems, Programming Models and Applications**

[KDD 2016](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/), August 13, San Francisco

 > This workshop aims to bring together people from both academia and industry to present their most recent work related to these issues, and exchange ideas and thoughts in order to advance this big data challenge. 

Our ability to collect data in various sensors, devices, formats, either from independent or connected applications, has significantly outpaced our capability to process, analyze, store and understand these datasets. Social networking applications like Facebook and Twitter that allow users to freely create contents, further amplify the already huge volume of web data. Furthermore, with smartphones now becoming ubiquitous, these devices are becoming the sensory gateway to get real-time data on people from different aspects, the vast amount of data that mobile carriers can potentially process to improve our daily life has significantly outpaced our past CDR (call data record)-based processing for billing purposes only. People and devices (from home coffee machines to cars, to buses, railway stations and airports) are becoming more intricately connected. Trillions of such connected components will generate a huge data ocean, and valuable information must be discovered from the data to help improve quality of life and make our world a better place. 

 > The IoT and Big Data challenge that has been considered as one of the most exciting opportunities in the past 10 years.
